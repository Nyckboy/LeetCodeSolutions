# 1200. Minimum Absolute Difference

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Description

Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows

a, b are from arr
a < b
b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr

## Constraints

2 <= arr.length <= 105
-106 <= arr[i] <= 106

* ## Approach
