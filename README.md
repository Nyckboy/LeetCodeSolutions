# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions

A collection of my LeetCode solutions in **Java** and **JavaScript**, created to track my progress in Data Structures and Algorithms. 

The repository focuses on:
* **Clean Code:** Solutions are written to be readable and maintainable.
* **Efficiency:** Time and Space complexity analysis included for each problem.
* **Automation:** Contains custom shell/PowerShell scripts to streamline the folder creation process.

## 📂 Structure
Each problem is located in its own directory (e.g., `1-two-sum/`) containing:
1.  `README.md`: Problem description and constraints.
2.  `Solution.js`: The working code with complexity notes.

## 🛠️ Usage
This repo uses a custom script to generate boilerplate code.
